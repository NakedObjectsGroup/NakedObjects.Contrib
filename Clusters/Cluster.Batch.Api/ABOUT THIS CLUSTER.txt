Allows for the specification of processes to be run an scheduled intervals.
These processes, the calling frequency, start and end dates, can be defined, managed, and monitored through the UI.
(e.g. see when exactly it was run, and the outcome summary).
The service would be called at regular, minimal-resolution intervals (e.g. daily, or more frequently) called by
the Windows Task Scheduler, then inside the cluster domain code would determine which processes to fire.
Ideally, the set of processes that are capable of being fired would be held inside the cluster, and necessarily
require development time.  They would exist in other clusters. I assume these would be instantiable objects that
conform to some interface.
