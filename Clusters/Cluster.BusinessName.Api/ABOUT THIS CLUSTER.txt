Similar to the Name cluster (meaning 'Individual Name'), this cluster represents Business Names, hiding the complexity of the way that Business Names
are represented differently in different countries.

Cluster provides implementations for creating and retrieving names, searching for names, finding near matches and duplicates. 

Need to have the notion of a business entity that the name belongs to and also the scope (geographic, temporal, and otherwise).
